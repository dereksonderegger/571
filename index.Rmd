# Preface {-}

These notes are intended to be used in the second semester of a two-semester sequence of Statistical Methodology.  We assume that students have seen t-tests, Simple Regression, and ANOVA. The second semester emphasizes the uniform matrix notation $y = X\beta + \epsilon$ and the interpretation of the coefficients. We cover model diagnostics, transformation, model selection, interactions of continuous and categorical predictors as well as introduce random effects in the experimental design context. Finally we introduce logistic regression.
